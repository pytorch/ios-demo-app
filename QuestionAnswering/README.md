# Question Answering on iOS

## Introduction

Question Answering (QA) is one of the common and challenging Natural Language Processing tasks. With the revolutionary transformed-based [Bert](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) model coming out in October 2018, question answering models have reached their state of art accuracy by fine-tuning Bert-like models on QA datasets such as [Squad](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer). [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co)'s [DistilBert](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html) is a smaller and faster version of BERT - DistilBert "has 40% less parameters than bert-base-uncased, runs 60% faster while preserving over 95% of BERTâ€™s performances as measured on the GLUE language understanding benchmark."

In this demo app, we'll show how to quantize and convert the Huggingface's DistilBert QA model to TorchScript and how to use the scripted model on an iOS demo app to perform question answering.

## Prerequisites

* PyTorch 1.7 or later (Optional)
* Python 3.8 (Optional)
* iOS Pytorch pod library 1.7
* Xcode 12 or later

## Quick Start

To Test Run the iOS QA demo app, run the following commands on a Terminal:

### 1. Prepare the Model

If you don't have PyTorch installed or want to have a quick try of the demo app, you can download the scripted QA model compressed in a zip file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RWZa_5oSQg5AfInkn344DN3FJ5WbbZbq/view?usp=sharing), then unzip, drag and drop it to the project, and continue to Step 2.

With PyTorch 1.7 installed, run:
```
pip install transformers
python convert_distilbert_qa.py
```

Then drag and drop the model file qa360_quantized.pt to the iOS app project. [Dynamic quantization](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dynamic_quantization_bert_tutorial.html) is used to quantize the model to reduce its size to half without causing inference difference in question answering.

### 2. Use LibTorch

Run the commands below:

```
cd QuestionAnswering
pod install
open QuestionAnswering.xcworkspace/
```

### 3. Build and run with Xcode

Select an iOS simulator or device on Xcode to run the app. See this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QIB3yoP4I3zUU0bLCpvUqPV5Kv8f8JvB/view) for a screencast of the app running. Some example results are as follows:
